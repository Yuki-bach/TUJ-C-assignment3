# TUJ-C-assignments

## TUJ Summer semeseter (5/24/2021-7/28/2021)

## Course Objectives
This course introduces students to computer programming using the C language. Students will solve programming problems using procedural programming constructs such as variable assignment, loops, branching structures, and functions. Students will write programs that are testable (using assertions) and maintainable (using good programming style, naming conventions, indentation, and comments). Topics covered also include the general characteristics of computers, techniques of problem solving, and algorithm specification. Students also begin the debugging and testing of computer programs in the C language. Students are also introduced to software engineering practices, including unit testing techniques, debugging techniques, and version control management. This is a 4 credit-hour course. This means that 8-12 hours of work each week outside of lecture.
